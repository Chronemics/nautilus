				<h3>Chro-ne-mics: the study of time in communication</h3>
				<p>Chronemics was a journey for all of us. An excercise in emotional chaos. A constantly evolving experience encompasing time and rebirth. A poloriod of our anger, insecurities, lessons, and love. What began as a four-piece band in college eventually morphed into a studio project with a revolving door of contributors and the intent of preserving the real. Chronemics was written in sequence and refined over 3 years. Due to the amount of input over time, the album evolved alonside us as people, diverged, and was split into two parts. At it's core, Nautilus is: Lee, Evan, Nick, and Brijesh, although Chronemics saw the addition / contributions of: Will, Rich, Shawn, Yael, and Marc.
